# 3D 2048
Based on [Baiqiang's 2048-3d](https://github.com/Baiqiang/2048-3d).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](https://peppergrayxyz.github.io/2048-3d/)

## Changes from 3D 2048

* 2x2x2 grid
* No Special tiles

## How to play

Use your arrow keys to move the tiles, R(or Q) and F(or E) to move ahead and back, any useless letter key to rotate, hold 1, 2 or 3 to hide layers, ESC and 0 to restart. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!.
